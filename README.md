# Computer Organization Course Projects
This repository contains the projects I made for the Computer Organization course, written in C and Assembly. Every instruction file is in the relevant directory.
### Exercise 1
This project is the first and basic one, and contains C code that shows basic bitwise operations, endianness and more.  
### Exercise 2
This project if my first practice in Assembly code, and demonstrates basic operations, conditions and more.
### Exercise 3
This is my major project in Assembly language, contains complex control operations, jump tables, loops and more.  
### Exercise 4
This is a code optimization project written in C. We were given a slow, non-efficient code and we needed to optimize it. The faster you got, the higher the score, in relations to the rest of the class. I was in the top 40, running in under 8 ms in average (while most ran over 10 ms).  
The final exercise (number 5) was the Binary Bomb Lab, which required reverse engineering skills.
